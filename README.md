# Airflow Project

This repository contains the setup and configuration for our Airflow environment, a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Below is a breakdown of the structure and purpose of each component.

## Folders and Files Overview

### `dag/`
This directory houses the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In Airflow, a DAG is a collection of tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies.

### `data/`
The `data/` directory is intended for data-related resources, such as temporary storage, intermediate datasets, or even initial datasets for testing. While Airflow itself doesn't mandate a `data/` directory, it's a common best practice for organization.

### `plugins/`
Airflow allows for custom user-created extensions via plugins. The `plugins/` folder contains these extensions, which can range from custom operators, hooks, sensors, interfaces, and more.

### `docker-compose.yaml`
This YAML file holds various configuration settings related to the Airflow setup. YAML, which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", is a human-readable data serialization format that’s a superset of JSON. In the context of our project, it helps in ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

### `.env`

The `.env` file is a pivotal component in software development, particularly for managing environment-specific variables. It's commonly used to store configuration settings and environment data like database URLs, API keys, and other confidential credentials. By segregating these values from the codebase, we can ensure enhanced security, increased portability, and greater flexibility in our development environment.

## Docker

We use Docker to containerize our Airflow environment. Docker offers an efficient and consistent way to build and deploy applications, ensuring that our Airflow setup remains isolated and consistent across various environments.

Containerizing Airflow with Docker ensures that our workflows, including all their dependencies, are bundled together. This guarantees that they execute the same way, irrespective of where Docker runs.

## Conclusion

Our Airflow setup, bolstered by Docker, guarantees efficient, reproducible, and scalable workflow execution. The organized structure — from DAGs to plugins — aids in maintaining clarity, while the YAML configurations ensure consistency.
